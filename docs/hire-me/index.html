<h1 id="hello-">hello üëãüèº<a href="#hello-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer primarily working on cloud applications and infrastructure. I have experiences in refactoring Ruby projects for performance and building test infrastructure for Kubernetes products. Specifically, I am interested in the human component of our computer system.</p>
<p>I would like to work with empathetic people who value sustainability (and therefore slack) of an organization. In a world obsessed with uptime, our industry often forgets to leave breathing room for humans to live.</p>
<p>A good friend and former colleague once said that I am a closeted Product Manager, but I personally like to think that I&rsquo;m more of a T-shaped engineer ‚Äî I have decent idea of how things work across the stack, while my extensive expertise is on building and operating (capital-S) Systems.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-me">working with me<a href="#working-with-me" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>My activity in the recent years has been around open-source product and community. As such, I find asynchronous communication by default to be preferable. Not only it removes the &ldquo;meetings which could have been emails&rdquo;, but also encourages more thoughtful writing and reading.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&rsquo;m a proponent of paired programming. Pairing taught me to be more articulate in my ideas and more receptive of criticisms. <a href="https://youtu.be/VzWLGMtXflg">Sandi Metz said that our industry is insufficiently persuasive</a>, and pairing is a wonderful way to nurture those skills in an organization, IMHO. Not to say that we should pair program all the time, but there is value in doing it and <strong>making it acceptable to be done effectively in your organization</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="lets-talk-ruby">let&rsquo;s talk ruby<a href="#lets-talk-ruby" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I have hosted several sessions on Ruby at workplace, particularly for ramping up engineers with no Ruby experience to an established Ruby project. I led design, implementation, and eventually roll out of Ruby performance initiatives which sped up code execution by 60%. <a href="/w/202112070000">I like to have fun when I write Ruby</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ship-the-containers">ship the containers<a href="#ship-the-containers" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In open-source, I contributed to Kubernetes to <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99178">migrate the last container image to Distroless</a>, removing false positive CVE signals from image scanners. I also worked on <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/search?q=wilsonehusin">Kubernetes release team in several release cycles</a> to compile release notes as well as maintaining the tooling for it.</p>
<h2 id="version-control-everything">version-control everything<a href="#version-control-everything" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>My personal development setup is on <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a> and only for the reason that machine setup can be version-controlled. I&rsquo;m glad to maintain a consistent experience across several machines with ease. I also do my best to create Git-oriented workflow for my projects, that deploys run on Continuous Integration (CI) server instead of my computer, because I want to leave breadcrumbs for future self.</p>
<p>For the record, I would love to have a job interview where I would bring a project and talk about it as an assessment of my literacy and cooperativeness.</p>
<h2 id="have-some-fun">have some fun<a href="#have-some-fun" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I like to think of software development like cooking, <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">inspired by this blog by Robin Sloan</a>. I happen to be quite good that someone pays me to do it, but I also like to do it for myself. <a href="https://go.xargs.dev/archy">I build silly things</a> as an equivalent of &ldquo;making cookies for the house today&rdquo; ‚Äî because it&rsquo;s fun!</p>
