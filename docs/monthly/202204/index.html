<p>We were in Los Angeles earlier this month. While I did not get as much tacos as I wanted, I did get <a href="/pictures/202204050000">a beautiful bowl of Tsukemen from Tsujita</a>. Absolutely lovely.</p>
<p>I still cook a lot, which at this point does not really come as news to anyone. Personal favorite from the last month is <a href="/pictures/202204210000">Halal Guys chicken platter</a>. My confession is that I have only eaten lamb and steak at Halal Guys, so I can&rsquo;t honestly compare between what I made and the original.</p>
<h1 id="bindl-its-public">bindl: it&rsquo;s public!<a href="#bindl-its-public" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>After writing out last month&rsquo;s update, I practically worked on Bindl most of the time I was on my computer. The project is finally public on <a href="https://bindl.dev">bindl.dev</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, I have started a few other projects which uses Bindl as a dependency manager. The exercise of using-your-own tools led me to building <a href="https://github.com/bindl-dev/bindl/blob/main/action.yaml">Bindl Action</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/bindl-dev/bindl/blob/main/bootstrap.sh">bootstrap script</a>.</p>
<p>Still far from perfect, and certainly lots of improvements to be made. I have reached out to several people over personal message to tell them about it, but I don&rsquo;t think it has rang much excitement. At least I know this is already making one person happy in this world: me. If you&rsquo;d like to increase that number, I would love for you to be my guest and let me know what you think!</p>
<h1 id="gomodurl">gomodurl<a href="#gomodurl" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>In some of my Go projects, I used a custom module import URL (e.g. <code>go.husin.dev/differ</code> and <code>go.xargs.dev/archy</code>). The hosting management for those URLs had moved twice: hacky Jekyll redirects on GitHub Pages and a deployed <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/govanityurls">GoogleCloudPlatform/govanityurls</a> instance on <a href="https://fly.io">Fly</a>.</p>
<p>For the most part, it has been nearly zero maintenance, except that every new project / redirect rule, I would have to redeploy. Sure, it wasn&rsquo;t much of hassle with automation from GitHub Actions, but it&rsquo;s still another thing to worry about.</p>
<p>Well, how hard would it be to write it myself that it auto-discovers new repositories?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wilsonehusin/gomodurl">It turned out to be a quite fun day hack and it&rsquo;s live now</a>. This project replaced &ldquo;commit every new repository&rdquo; activity with &ldquo;polling GitHub every hour&rdquo;. You too can use vanity URLs with minimal configurations now!</p>
<h1 id="thoughtful-online-presence">thoughtful online presence<a href="#thoughtful-online-presence" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>For the last few <del>months</del> years, I have been on and off blogging while also moving from different tools and engines. I also started accumulating a list of domains for &ldquo;projects&rdquo; which only half of them ever made itself out.</p>
<p>With Twitter&rsquo;s recent acquisition event as a forcing function, I have finally decided to consolidate everything to one site: the one you are looking at now. I believe I have also made all previous domains redirect to <code>husin.dev</code>, so let me know if you find one that is still lost.</p>
<p>I have deactivated my Facebook and Instagram accounts a while back. While I&rsquo;m likely going to keep my Twitter account &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;, I foresee myself losing interest in the near future as the people I care to read on Twitter are leaving the platform.</p>
<p>And so everything goes down to this site. I&rsquo;m looking forward to posting more stories in pictures and words here.</p>
<p>I do not aim to write reference-quality content like <a href="https://danluu.com">Dan Luu</a>, <a href="https://jvns.ca">Julia Evans</a>, or <a href="https://apenwarr.ca">Avery Pennarun</a> (all of which I am a fan of). Not saying never, just that it&rsquo;s out of scope to put the goal on &ldquo;writing something useful&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For now, I aim to &ldquo;write more mundane things&rdquo; — something I wish my friends would also do, as I would love to read their words and have a reason to break the cycle of silence with talking about their new coffee brewing routine or maybe even laundry detergent. Let me know if you&rsquo;d like to join me!</p>
