      <description>food We were in Los Angeles earlier this month. While I did not get as much tacos as I wanted, I did get a beautiful bowl of Tsukemen from Tsujita. Absolutely lovely.
I still cook a lot, which at this point does not really come as news to anyone. Personal favorite from the last month is Halal Guys chicken platter. My confession is that I have only eaten lamb and steak at Halal Guys, so I can&amp;rsquo;t honestly compare between what I made and the original.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We were in Los Angeles earlier this month. While I did not get as much tacos as I wanted, I did get &lt;a href=&#34;/pictures/202204050000&#34;&gt;a beautiful bowl of Tsukemen from Tsujita&lt;/a&gt;. Absolutely lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still cook a lot, which at this point does not really come as news to anyone. Personal favorite from the last month is &lt;a href=&#34;/pictures/202204210000&#34;&gt;Halal Guys chicken platter&lt;/a&gt;. My confession is that I have only eaten lamb and steak at Halal Guys, so I can&amp;rsquo;t honestly compare between what I made and the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bindl-its-public&#34;&gt;bindl: it&amp;rsquo;s public!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing out last month&amp;rsquo;s update, I practically worked on Bindl most of the time I was on my computer. The project is finally public on &lt;a href=&#34;https://bindl.dev&#34;&gt;bindl.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have started a few other projects which uses Bindl as a dependency manager. The exercise of using-your-own tools led me to building &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bindl-dev/bindl/blob/main/action.yaml&#34;&gt;Bindl Action&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bindl-dev/bindl/blob/main/bootstrap.sh&#34;&gt;bootstrap script&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still far from perfect, and certainly lots of improvements to be made. I have reached out to several people over personal message to tell them about it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it has rang much excitement. At least I know this is already making one person happy in this world: me. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to increase that number, I would love for you to be my guest and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;gomodurl&#34;&gt;gomodurl&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of my Go projects, I used a custom module import URL (e.g. &lt;code&gt;go.husin.dev/differ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;go.xargs.dev/archy&lt;/code&gt;). The hosting management for those URLs had moved twice: hacky Jekyll redirects on GitHub Pages and a deployed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/govanityurls&#34;&gt;GoogleCloudPlatform/govanityurls&lt;/a&gt; instance on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fly.io&#34;&gt;Fly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, it has been nearly zero maintenance, except that every new project / redirect rule, I would have to redeploy. Sure, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of hassle with automation from GitHub Actions, but it&amp;rsquo;s still another thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, how hard would it be to write it myself that it auto-discovers new repositories?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wilsonehusin/gomodurl&#34;&gt;It turned out to be a quite fun day hack and it&amp;rsquo;s live now&lt;/a&gt;. This project replaced &amp;ldquo;commit every new repository&amp;rdquo; activity with &amp;ldquo;polling GitHub every hour&amp;rdquo;. You too can use vanity URLs with minimal configurations now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;thoughtful-online-presence&#34;&gt;thoughtful online presence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few &lt;del&gt;months&lt;/del&gt; years, I have been on and off blogging while also moving from different tools and engines. I also started accumulating a list of domains for &amp;ldquo;projects&amp;rdquo; which only half of them ever made itself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Twitter&amp;rsquo;s recent acquisition event as a forcing function, I have finally decided to consolidate everything to one site: the one you are looking at now. I believe I have also made all previous domains redirect to &lt;code&gt;husin.dev&lt;/code&gt;, so let me know if you find one that is still lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have deactivated my Facebook and Instagram accounts a while back. While I&amp;rsquo;m likely going to keep my Twitter account &amp;ldquo;clickable&amp;rdquo;, I foresee myself losing interest in the near future as the people I care to read on Twitter are leaving the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so everything goes down to this site. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to posting more stories in pictures and words here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not aim to write reference-quality content like &lt;a href=&#34;https://danluu.com&#34;&gt;Dan Luu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jvns.ca&#34;&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://apenwarr.ca&#34;&gt;Avery Pennarun&lt;/a&gt; (all of which I am a fan of). Not saying never, just that it&amp;rsquo;s out of scope to put the goal on &amp;ldquo;writing something useful&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I aim to &amp;ldquo;write more mundane things&amp;rdquo; — something I wish my friends would also do, as I would love to read their words and have a reason to break the cycle of silence with talking about their new coffee brewing routine or maybe even laundry detergent. Let me know if you&amp;rsquo;d like to join me!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>making ragù and pasta I made a lot of pasta this month. For the most part, I’m giving credit to Kenji’s video on Ragù Bolognese which led me to make it for the first time early March. It was a lot of effort cutting and prepping the ingredients, but most of the cooking was just in the background simmering. I also froze them using ice cube trays and just pop several to cook them during weekdays, tasty in 10 minutes!</description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;poking-coffee-clumps&#34;&gt;poking coffee clumps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been making espresso for a while now. At the pursuit of flavor, espresso making involves a lot of preparation for the coffee grounds before pressurized water go through. Conveniently, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/xb3IxAr4RCo&#34;&gt;James Hoffmann made a video on this topic recently&lt;/a&gt;, which to my surprise is quite close to what I do every day. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/tekmjb/i_love_my_daily_routine_but_do_you_ever_pause_for/&#34;&gt;Modern espresso is strange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/monthly/202203/wdt.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Weiss Distribution Technique (WDT) tool, where the idea is to use acupuncture needles to break up clumps in espresso puck preparation.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, this is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.etsy.com/listing/1185798417/business-card-9-prong-wdt-assembly&#34;&gt;distribution tool I found on Etsy&lt;/a&gt;. The whole point (hah) is to break up coffee ground clumps into smooth powder such that water can flow evenly through the puck. The concept isn’t new per se — people have been making these tools with 3D printer for a while. But &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/oo3o1n/3d_printed_wdt_tool_now_upgraded_improved_and/&#34;&gt;most of them have a conic-shape&lt;/a&gt;, which increases the cost of shipping, ultimately putting the prices around $20-$30. This new design was created with eliminating that cost in mind, such that it can be shipped in an envelope. Brilliant idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen a picture of a city where you live in and thought, “wow, this looks like a dream, I want to be there”? I’m lucky to experience that a lot, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isthelaststop/status/1508691157970157573&#34;&gt;Vallery Lancey&lt;/a&gt;. She takes beautiful pictures of San Francisco, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isthelaststop/status/1508012887473762305&#34;&gt;often through transit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BART is my first choice of travel strategy to San Francisco and East Bay. Sometimes Muni buses in San Francisco, if not walking all the way (despite the hills, San Francisco is quite convenient to walk everywhere). That said, I took the first ride of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/muni-metro-light-rail&#34;&gt;Muni Metro Light Rail (LRV)&lt;/a&gt; in March — they are very pleasant! The last time I rode something similar was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kcstreetcar.org/&#34;&gt;Kansas City Streetcar&lt;/a&gt;. I’m lucky that some evenings, I would see pictures from Vallery and I can just go experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;little-luca-beeg-beeg-luca&#34;&gt;little luca? BEEG BEEG LUCA!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nearby sandwich shop called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-lucca-specialty-sandwich-shop-south-san-francisco&#34;&gt;Little Luca&lt;/a&gt; which often has a long line whenever I pass by. Recently I went to get one and try it out for myself. I got a tri-tip special sandwich on dutch crunch bread. They taste great and honestly even better the next day as the sauce makes its way through the bread and the bread gets reheated in air fryer / convection oven. I don’t know who this little guy is, but sure seems like they have big mouth and belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/monthly/202203/little-luca-side-view.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Side view of tri-tip special sandwich from Little Luca.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on a project to manage binaries for a few weeks now. There are still some work to be done before it’s published publicly, but I think &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/1SrqtGOxXgk&#34;&gt;this 3 minute video&lt;/a&gt; gives a reasonable idea of what this product experience can / should be. Some updates have been made since then, though the significant part is I would like to share the maintenance post-launch with a community. I thought I’m “a few days away to launching” but I guess time is very elastic when your day isn’t on a 9-5 schedule. Hopefully soon!&lt;/p&gt;
