      <description>I am somehow in possession of these thin, but otherwise okay plastic bowls. Quite plenty of them.
Instead of being wasteful and throwing them out after single-use, I decided to have fun and play some arts and crafts with it. Not too shabby, I think. Likely I will add paper filter on top of the coffee bed for better water distribution next time.
30 grams coffee with 300 grams ice (1:10 ratio) over 10+ hours.</description>
