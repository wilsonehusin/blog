I have not written SQL in a while, and today I know I needed to define a column with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
However, playing out the deletion scenario in my head was challenging (i.e. should it be here or the other table?) â€” it felt like the first time learning SQL.

I found a DBA StackExchange thread that was helpful: [SQL:2011 Spec of `ON DELETE` behaviors](https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/213239).
