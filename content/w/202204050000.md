I once stumbled on a story from the era of workers’ competence in Silicon Valley being measured through brainteasers: (paraphrased, recited from memory)

> Let’s ask a candidate: “Alice would like Bob to call her in the future and Alice would like to keep her phone number private. What should Alice do?”
>
> Microsoft would want you to elaborate cryptographic scheme for Alice and Bob to communicate secretly.
>
> However, Google would want you to start with: “Alice should tell Bob to call them, and provide backup plan if Bob has trouble doing so.”

Every now and then, I think about this and how my impression of the author’s tone is more about showing the culture at the two companies instead of a puzzle worth solving in an interview.

Today, something else clicked in my head: the supposedly Google-way of doing it somewhat resembles how content delivery network (CDN) works — make a request with [`ETag`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) attached (using `If-None-Match` header) and server will respond with `HTTP 304` (i.e. “you are up to date!”) or content with new `ETag` will be served in the reply. This allows the potential to save up transfer cost of files from server.

This is partially relevant to human interactions too. [No hello](https://nohello.net) is often favored to reduce the expensive communication overhead.
