The picture above has nothing to do with the post, except that I just finished updating `<meta>` tags in the templates and now posts with pictures can have link preview with pictures, while having custom `alt` text in the post.

If you are using the same [`hugo terminal theme`](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/) like this blog, you can do it by overriding the [partials](https://github.com/wilsonehusin/blog/commit/06558a5a334bfbcb29f1e342faefe4d1c5174c94#diff-dd30a18c966d1e96b055d5c9955d9d8ef1200159705fb5a6323ceb4a89db5be7) (by default, the alt text is post title, which I think isn't quite enough for the way I post pictures).
