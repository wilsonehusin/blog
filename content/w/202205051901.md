Have you ever wondered the performance comparison of directory traversal between a regular filesystem and a filesystem implemented in SQLite database?
No?
Well, I did, and I couldn't come up with a strong argument on which one would be faster.

So, as a scientist[^1], I thought it would be fun to do a benchmarking experiment without having strong hypothesis on how things will go.

[^1]: _as a scientist_: I don't really consider myself as one, but I am in possession of a paper to claim that I am.

## constraints

- The test will be using Go, specifically [`fs.WalkDir`](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#WalkDir).
- Therefore, SQLite implementation will be as simple as "satisfying what Go thinks of a file / filesystem".

## implementation

It started by classifying two different archetype of pointers: directories and files.
A directory can point to directories and / or files, while a file can only point to itself which contains the content of a file.

{{<
  code language="sql"
  id="litefs-schema"
  title="Schema definition describing filesystem directories and files." expand="Show" collapse="Hide"
>}}
CREATE TABLE litefs_entry (
  id TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_id TEXT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  modtime TEXT NOT NULL,
  content BLOB,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) references litefs_entry(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  UNIQUE (parent_id, name)
);
{{< /code >}}

To stay on track, I limited myself to just implementing [`fs.ReadDirFS`](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#ReadDirFS).

I used [kyleconroy/sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc) to generate the bindings of SQL queries and Go structs.
I also used [mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) for SQLite driver.

And now, it's time to draw [the rest of the owl](https://github.com/wilsonehusin/litefs/blob/3d09a27527ea3a1a1bbc40a7ed3b9a61ed19bc1e/fs.go).

## benchmarking

With the first minimal implementation done, I started writing the benchmark test.

{{<
  code language="go"
  id="litefs-benchmark"
  title="Benchmark testing code for LiteFS in comparison to OS file system" expand="Show" collapse="Hide"
>}}
func BenchmarkProfLiteFSWalkNoop(b *testing.B) {
  /* initialization, etc. */

  // lfs is a LiteFS instance.
  // lfs.Merge copies over a fs.FS interface into LiteFS.
  if err := lfs.Merge(context.Background(), os.DirFS(testDirPath), "."); err != nil {
    b.Fatal(err)
  }

  b.ResetTimer()
  for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
    if err := fs.WalkDir(lfs, ".", func(_ string, _ fs.DirEntry, err error) error {
      return err
    }); err != nil {
      b.Error(err)
    }
  }
}

func BenchmarkProfOSFSWalkNoop(b *testing.B) {
  osFS := os.DirFS(testDirPath)
  for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
    if err := fs.WalkDir(osFS, ".", func(_ string, _ fs.DirEntry, err error) error {
      return err
    }); err != nil {
      b.Error(err)
    }
  }
}
{{< /code >}}

The structure of `testDirPath` is:
- `foo/one/bar.txt`
- `foo/two/bar.txt`
- `foo/three/bar.txt`

I did say that I have no idea how the result would be, so I should not really be surprised by any result.

```

PASS
ok      go.husin.dev/litefs     2.647s
```

And yet, seeing how my implementation is ~20x slower,
with ~10x more memory allocations somewhat caught me off guard.

One thing worth noting is that [SQLite is supposedly faster than filesystem in reading files by 35%](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html).
This wasn't explored today, maybe someday!

## addendum

Through [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof), I was able to retrieve more data on resource consumption.

My interpretation is that much of resources were consumed to execute `runtime.cgocall` (specifically referring to the first peak from the right).
If that is true, then I think it's fair to imply that _likely_ either (or both) is correct:

- my SQL queries can be further optimized
- the SQLite driver is the bottleneck

In real product development, I would lean towards investigating the former as I expect it would yield the most return on my investment.

_But_, this isn't. And I get to choose what's _fun_ over anything else.

So, I'm going to use my creative license — what if we swap the SQLite driver with a different one?
I managed to find 3 SQLite drivers (including the currently used):

- [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)
- [modernc.org/sqlite](https://mordenc.org/sqlite)
- [github.com/tailscale/sqlite](https://github.com/tailscale/sqlite)

```

```

Tailscale's driver seems to be faster by ~20% — the pprof graph for it:

{{<

I'm not sure I have a profound-enough statement on this graph.
One thing that stands out to me is that the next optimization potential seem to be my query logic, i.e. `db.(*Query).ListEntries`.
