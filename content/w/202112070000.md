I was looking for an excuse to revisit Ruby after writing a lot of Go in the recent months, so I thought I would do something with [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com).

I had learned about Bored API recently from [a talk by Justin Searls](https://youtu.be/g2zJC2XKblo). In short, Bored API is an endpoint returning random values with the option of querying based on parameters.

<!--more-->

```sh
❯ curl -sSL https://boredapi.com/api/activity?type=busywork | jq
{
  "activity": "Draft your living will",
  "type": "busywork",
  "participants": 1,
  "price": 0,
  "link": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/livingwill.asp",
  "key": "2360432",
  "accessibility": 0.5
}
```

# The Ruby parts

Let's try making a Ruby client for Bored API! Something simple that would let us do:

```ruby
Activity.new(response).type # => "busywork"
```

## Naive

Given a JSON string to process, a boring (_ha ha_) approach can look something like this:

```ruby
require "json"

class Activity
  attr_reader :activity,
    :type,
    :participants,
    :price,
    :link,
    :key,
    :accessibility

  # @param raw_string [String] JSON string returned by Bored API
  def initialize(raw_string)
    response_data = JSON.parse raw_string

    @activity = response_data["activity"]
    @type = response_data["type"]
    @participants = response_data["participants"]
    @price = response_data["price"]
    @link = response_data["link"]
    @key = response_data["key"]
    @accessibility = response_data["accessibility"]
  end

  # Quack
  def name
    activity
  end
end
```

Now with a valid input, we can expect the following to work:

```ruby
Activity.new(response).name # => "Draft your living will!"
```

Alright, that worked. `attr_reader` saved us from writing multiple method definitions for the properties. However, we are currently front-loading the data parsing, which we can optimize with memoization tricks.

## Lazy evaluation

One trick that we will do here is to store the `raw_string` value and parse only when needed.

```ruby
def initialize(raw_string)
  @raw_string = raw_string
end

def response_data
  @response_data ||= JSON.parse @raw_string
end
```

Although that means we can't use `attr_reader` anymore. To maintain functionality, we need to add something like the following to _every property_.

```ruby
def participants
  @participants ||= response_data["participants"]
end
```

Now that class doesn't look so elegant anymore, does it? More than half of the methods defined in the class look like copy-pasted template.

## (Mis)using `method_missing`

If you, like me, have a fond memory of the talk [Wat by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), you might remember that Ruby has a method `method_missing` in `BasicObject` ([doc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/BasicObject.html#method-i-method_missing)).

So, instead of writing `def participants` like above, we can write one method to cover all the properties of an `Activity`.

```ruby
PROPERTIES = %i[activity type participants price link key accessibility]
def method_missing(method_name, *args, &block)
  super unless PROPERTIES.include? method_name
  response_data[method_name.to_s]
end
```

## More memoization with `class_eval`

Some might say that they dislike `method_missing` and would rather use `class_eval` ([doc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Module.html#method-i-class_eval)) like [how Faraday gem does it](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday/blob/65b8d3904f3a62e19444c9f4b7ef5b3ffe7e3e6d/lib/faraday/connection.rb#L197-L206). This approach would also allow us to bring back memoization per property, instead of accessing the `Hash` object on every method call.

```ruby
PROPERTIES = %i[activity type participants price link key accessibility]
PROPERTIES.each do |prop|
  class_eval <<-RUBY, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
    def #{prop}
      @#{prop} ||= response_data["#{prop}"]
    end
  RUBY
end
```

## Following convention with `define_method`

We have reached a point where we stray further from truth, where arguably, this is an over-complication of `attr_reader`. What if we could make something like `attr_reader`? Let me introduce you to `define_method` ([doc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Module.html#method-i-define_method)).

```ruby
module Bored
  def prop_reader(*props)
    props.each do |prop|
      define_method prop do |p|
        response_data[p.to_s]
      end
    end
  end
  
  class Activity
    prop_reader :activity,
      :type,
      :participants,
      :price,
      :link,
      :key,
      :accessibility
    ...
  end
end
```

Thanks for reading this silly thought experiment! I had lots of fun writing it.

In a less silly fashion, I once wrote about [getting familiar with Ruby syntax](https://gist.github.com/wilsonehusin/dee7cf99ad6f1d94369dc6f31268a600) and [building duck-typed objects in Ruby](https://gist.github.com/wilsonehusin/cbcf6d98207c596837351f4dd87e539a).
