I am somehow in possession of these thin, but otherwise okay plastic bowls.
Quite plenty of them.

Instead of being wasteful and throwing them out after single-use, I decided to have fun and play some arts and crafts with it.
Not too shabby, I think.
Likely I will add paper filter on top of the coffee bed for better water distribution next time.
