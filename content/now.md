- still on leave from day job
- looking for more of delicious meal-prepping ideas
- cleaning up personal domains and deployments, created these along the way:
  - [`bindl/spartan`](https://github.com/bindl-dev/spartan) for `HTTP 3xx` redirect rules
  - [`gomodurl`](https://github.com/wilsonehusin/gomodurl) for vanity domain in go module imports (e.g. [`go.husin.dev/gomodurl`](https://go.husin.dev/gomodurl))
- started doing v3 routes (and bouldering more than once a week)
